# Stock_Price_Prediction
predicting the Reliance stock price using LSTM, this project given by Bharath Intern

The project is a stock price prediction project using the LSTM model. The code first imports the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Keras. Then, it loads the stock price data from a CSV file. The data is pre-processed by removing the columns that are not needed and scaling the data.
The LSTM model is then created. The model has 100 hidden units and uses the Adam optimizer. The model is trained on the pre-processed data for 100 epochs.
After the model is trained, it is used to predict the stock prices. The predicted prices are compared to the actual prices to evaluate the performance of the model.
The project also includes a visualization of the predicted and actual prices. The visualization shows that the predicted prices are generally close to the actual prices.
Overall, the project is a good example of how to use the LSTM model for stock price prediction. The code is well-documented and easy to follow. The project also includes a visualization of the results, which is helpful for understanding the performance of the model.
